\title{Create a plot comparing effects within two datasets}
\usage{
effect_plot(
  dat,
  pheno_x = "x_pheno",
  pheno_y = "y_pheno",
  annotate_with = "Gene_Symbol",
  thresh = 1e-08,
  ci_thresh = 1,
  gene_label_thresh = 1e-08,
  color = get_topr_colors()[1],
  scale = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{The input dataframe (snpset) containing one row per variant and P values (P1 and P2) and effects (E1 and E2) from two datasets/phenotypes}

\item{pheno_x}{A string representing the name of the phenotype whose effect is plotted on the x axis}

\item{pheno_y}{A string representing the name of the phenotype whose effect is plotted on the y axis}

\item{annotate_with}{A string, The name of the column that contains the label for the datapoints (default value is Gene_Symbol)}

\item{thresh}{A number. Threshold cutoff, datapoints with P2 below this threshold are shown as filled circles whereas datapoints with P2 above this threshold are shown as open circles}

\item{ci_thresh}{A number.Show the confidence intervals if the P-value is below this threshold}

\item{gene_label_thresh}{A string, label datapoints with P2 below this threshold}

\item{color}{A string, default value is the first of the topr colors}

\item{scale}{A number, to change the size of the title and axes labels and ticks at the same time (default = 1)}
